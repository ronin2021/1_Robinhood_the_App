# Robinhood and the Attempt to Democratize of the Finance

## Overview and Origin

#### Founders, the Idea, and Incorporation

Robinhood is a reasonably new Fintech company which was incorporated April, 2013. Stanford graduates Vladimir Tenev and Baiju Bhatt founded the company in Menlo Park, California. While working/building high frequency trading platforms in New York city they noted that typical trading platforms incur fraction of dollar, on the order of few pennies, while charging customers $5 to $10 per trade. Further, it was (and still is to certain extent) required that the individual investor sustain a minimum dollar value in their account, which typically varies between $500 to $5000, depending on the broker. Tanev and Bhatt wanted to remove this barrier and encourage anyone who has some money that they could invest to participate in buying equity, not just the reasonably wealthy. 

#### Capital Raised and Growth

Robinhood has manged to attract substantial cash inflows via close, successive funding rounds which attest to the robustness of their product, messaging and marketing in convincing sophisticated tech Venture Capital (VC) firms in the Silicon Valley. In its onset funding started with a Seed round (2013) at $3mil from a collection of boutique VC firms (led by Andreessen Horowitz et. al.,), followed by a Series A round at $13mil (2014) led by Index Ventures. This was followed by a Series B round at $50mil (2015) led by Index Ventures, then a Series B round (2017) at $110mil at Valuation of $1.3bil (then becoming a bonafide Unicorn) again led by Index Ventures. 

More recently, from May of 2018 to August of 2020, successive Series D, D-2, E, E-1, F, F, G-1 funding rounds attrated a cumulative capital of $1.5bil, capping off with Series G-2 in Covid hit September of 2020 of $460mil at a postmoney valuation of $11.7bil lead by Sequoia Capital.

Robinhood is still privately held and likely to remain so in near future. The recent abundance of SPACs and having convinced VC firms with deep pockets will likely guarentee a ready supply of growth capital with the control so desired by the founders as opposed to an IPO.   

## Business Activities

#### Customer Pain Points Addressed

Since trading stocks via then-existing brokerages can be expensive and requires some reasonable capital to park in their brokerage. This removes a certain demography of users from participating in the capital markets.  Such bariers can be considerable pain points and disenfranchise a large group of people from participating on equity markets.     

#### Addressable Market

Average age of the Robinhood app user is 27years, and the upper bound is at 35 years in age if a bellcurve distribution is assumed the lower bound is likely at 19 years for Robinhood app users. Average capital invested per user varies between $1k to $5k, which correlates with the demography very well. Current user base is 13million Robinhood app users  collectively amounts to about $65bil which is 0.1% of the total US equity market of $49tri. However there is much room to grow, some of which already realized by Robinhood from opening new markets by giving previous non traders oppertunity to trade.     

#### Competitive Advantages

Robinhood utilizes a few competitive advantages. From its onset it let traders do $0 fee trades, industry first at the time. It first launched primarily as mobile app on smartphones and its webplatform as a secondary. This was also an industry first at the time. Its app improved its ease of use and added crypo trading to its offerings and is consistantly ranked as one of the best brokerage apps available. Collectively innovation, propritery information, and interlectual property as exibited by the app and the platform could be considered as sources of sustainable competitive advantage for Robinhood against its competitors.        

#### Technology Edge

Prior to Robinhood, Tenev and Bhatt founded Chronos Research. Here they built automated trading platforms for hedge funds and investment banks. In Robinhood they extended same technologies to the general public. The brilliance of Robinhood is that they married these capabilities to a mobile app that is significantly userfriendy to make trading an everyday hassle free experience.
