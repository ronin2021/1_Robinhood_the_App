# Robinhood: App that Stands Apart

## Overview and Origin

#### Founders, the Idea, and Incorporation

Incorporated in April, 2013, Robinhood is a comparatively new Fintech firm. Stanford graduates Vladimir Tenev and Baiju Bhatt founded the company in Menlo Park, California. While working/building high frequency trading platforms in New York city they noted that typical trading platforms incur fraction of dollar, on the order of few pennies, while charging customers $5 to $10 per trade (in 2019, online brokerages en masse cancelled fees citing competitive pressures from Robinhood). Further, it was (and practce still exists in some cases) required that the individual investor sustain a minimum dollar value in their account, which typically varies between $500 to $5000, depending on the broker. Tanev and Bhatt wanted to remove this barrier and encourage anyone who has some saving be able to invest on equity, not just the reasonably well off. 

#### Capital Raised and Growth

Robinhood has manged to attract substantial cash inflows via close, successive funding rounds which attest to the robustness of their product, messaging and marketing in convincing sophisticated tech Venture Capital (VC) outfits in the Silicon Valley. In its onset funding started with a Seed round (2013) at $3mil from a collection of boutique VC firms (led by Andreessen Horowitz et. al.,), followed by a Series A round at $13mil (2014) led by Index Ventures. This was followed by a Series B round at $50mil (2015) led by Index Ventures, then a Series B round (2017) at $110mil at Valuation of $1.3bil (then becoming a bonafide Unicorn) again led by Index Ventures. 

More recently, from May of 2018 to August of 2020, successive Series D, D-2, E, E-1, F, F, G-1 funding rounds attrated a cumulative capital of $1.5bil, capping off with Series G-2 in Covid hit September of 2020 of $460mil at a postmoney valuation of $11.7bil lead by Sequoia Capital.

Robinhood is still privately held and likely to remain so in the near future. The recent abundance of SPACs and having convinced VC firms with deep pockets of their success, will likely guarentee a ready supply of growth capital with the capcity to ratain control so desired by the founders as opposed to an IPO.   

## Business Activities

#### Customer Pain Points Addressed

Since trading stocks via then-existing brokerages can be expensive and requires some reasonable capital to park in their brokerage. This removes a certain demography of users from participating in the capital markets. Such bariers can be considerable pain points and could disenfranchise a large group of people from participating on equity markets.     

#### Addressable Market

Average age of the Robinhood app user is 27 years, and the upper bound is at 35 years in age if a bellcurve distribution is assumed the lower bound is likely at 19 years for Robinhood app users. Average capital invested per user varies between $1,000 to $5,000, which correlates with the liquidity of the demography very well. Current Robinhood user base is 13mil app users. They collectively amounts to about $20bil which is 0.04% of the total US equity market as of 2021 at a value of $49tri. However there is much room to grow, some of which already realized by Robinhood from opening new markets by giving previous non-traders the oppertunity to trade.     

#### Competitive Advantages

Robinhood utilizes a few competitive advantages. From its onset it let traders do $0 fee trades, industry first at the time. It first launched primarily as mobile app on smartphones and its webplatform as a secondary. This was also an industry first. Its app consistantly improved its ease of use and recently added crypo trading and banking to its offerings. The app is persitently ranked as one of the best brokerage apps available. Collectively innovation, propritery information, and interlectual property as exibited by the app and their platform could be considered as sources of sustainable competitive advantage for Robinhood against its competitors.        

#### Technology Edge

Prior to Robinhood, Tenev and Bhatt founded Chronos Research. Here they built automated trading platforms for hedge funds and investment banks. In Robinhood they extended same technologies to the general public. The brilliance of Robinhood is that they married these capabilities to a mobile app that is significantly userfriendy to make trading an everyday, hassle free experience.   

## Landscape

#### Fintech Domains 

Robinhood can be considered as a company straddling domains of Investment Managment, Wealth Managment, and Blockchain/Cryptocurrencies. Latter is the least representative of the Robinhood. 

#### Major Trends and Innovations in the Domains

These domains have seen significant shifts over the last decade. Webplatforms have become significantly userfriendly, with intuitive layouts and designs, and more so in their respective mobile apps. The updates of the information is faster, concise and digestable to help even the most newbie of the traders. Fees has been minimized if not eliminated entirely. At the same time offering of curated and tailored education comtent have expanded significantly. Firms in these domains started offering premium features such as socially resposible investing, tax strategies, estate planning, diversification, etc. to the masses.        

#### Major Players in these Domains

Over the last last decade or so many new competitors have emmerged. Each has certain points of differentiations but many offer perks that are now points of parities i.e., traders now expect these to be standard to even consider signing up with an online brokerage. A few comaprable Robinhood competitors are [M1 Finance](https://www.m1finance.com/?affiliateCode=VdlXgGTqexyLWiAxU-SAVSQkUkB2dVQF3xjE0A0&utm_source=1687836&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=10646&irgwc=1), [Firstrade](https://www.firstrade.com/content/en-us/welcome), [Webull](https://www.webull.com/activity/get-free-stocks?inviteCode=hFxO2CW56xbq&inviteSource=wb_kol_us), [TD Ameritrade](https://www.tdameritrade.com/why-td-ameritrade.html?adch=aff&CID=CJ2794183&cjevent=3548c57ab9f311eb800e01290a82b820&dclid=CjgKEAjwkZiFBhCV_4r-rduLlHsSJAB2ZHF_aTtgdlc-QjOJC26DcDvw0boSm_o9Uzx3Z8bdEqUSs_D_BwE), and [Interactive Brokers](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/index.php?f=1338). On the other hand there are more established competitors now affering online trading such as [Charles Schwab](https://www.schwab.com/promo/brokerage?src=SEM&ef_id=EAIaIQobChMIl8SGiY7b8AIVgP7jBx0-KggXEAAYASAAEgKkoPD_BwE:G:s&s_kwcid=AL!5158!3!473161389082!b!!g!!%2Bschwab%20%2Bbrokerage%20%2Bfirm!648355675!35764812185&keywordid=aud-314039084389:kwd-58953513020&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIl8SGiY7b8AIVgP7jBx0-KggXEAAYASAAEgKkoPD_BwE), [ETRADE](https://us.etrade.com/home?sr_id=BR&mp_id=57103585905&ch_id=p&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIuPzynI7b8AIVsv_jBx2pnwFCEAAYASAAEgL-MfD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds),[fidelity](https://www.fidelity.com/), [Ally West](https://www.ally.com/invest/), etc..  

## Results

#### Impact on the Sector

Robinhood introduced equity trading to a whole segment of the market low on the income ladder, has less sophistication, and demographocally younger who were also disaffectted with the big investment firms in Wallstreet since in the 2008 crash. When looked through this perspective Robinhood opened up new markets for brokerages by introduced new customers. Interms of the capital invested they may not have the same clout as the bigname traders (the likes of the big 4: Schwab, Fidelity, ETrade, and TD Ameritrade). However, Robinhood's lowcost trades, laser-like focus to the user experience and making their enterprise level trading technologies available to the general pupulus had a significant impact collectively on online and mobile app-based brokerage business.   

#### Core Performance Metrics in the Domain

Number of users, the quaterly growth of users, trading frequency, average value of an account, are combine value of the assets held, are a few metrics used to access the performance of online and mobile brokerages.    

#### Performance Relative to Competitors

When considering well established players with an online presence, Chares Schwab had a little above 12mil users with an average account value of $300,000. TD Ameritrade (which was acquired by Charles Schwab in 2019) had 12mil users with an average account value of $120,000 while ETRADE had a about 7mil users with an average account size of $90,000. When considering more tradition online traders, Vanguard is the biggest with $6.2tri in assets with 30mil accounts (not users, as this is not transparently available). 

When considering more comparrable firms such as, M1 Finance posted $2bil asstes in total with 500,000 user base. Another competitor, FirsTrade is also significantly smaller with total assts held at $4bil. Compare this to Robinhood, it has 13mil users as of 2021, with average account somewhere between $1,000 to $5,000 ($20bil in total assets under management). As a newcomer, for Robinhood, it's user base and its growth is certainly impressive. Having a younger demography of users however means average asset value is significantly lower.              

## Recommendations

#### Products/Services to Add Expand and Retain the Customer Base 

Two fundemental areas needs addressing. They are the education content (which is by far better in TD Amaritrade), robo-advising features ([Betterment](https://www.betterment.com/) has is a clear leader on this), and expanding crypto currency trading. 

A point of parity is where users drop a brokerage firm from a basket of different brokerage considerations they want to subscribe to. Consider air bags in a car (assume the regulators still allow this for a moment), it has become a norm to expect this as a safety feature and if a manufacturer would produce a car with out air bags would you ever consider buying it among other competitor vehicals? Probably not. When a significant number of competitors provide better education experience users who are getting sophisticated (and also likely earning more) would migrate to another brokerage where these services are readily available. 

Robo-advisory gives a novice user a safer way to buy and manage a portifolio.  Since many of the competitors are providing these services likely they can also become point of parity where users will decide to subscribe or not. 

Robinhood can be a few among the many who provide a bridge between crypto and more traditional asset swaps. Since traders likely going to have mixed bag this could add a significant ease of cross trading. As the user base natures and the crypto getting more main stream naturally they might seek these options actively.  

## Technologies to Utilize and the Path Forward 

Seamless intergration of curated educational content that blends with the mobile-app is a what Robinhood needs to target. Their lack of depth in this is apparent as a number of reviewrs scored Robinhood signifcantly lower due to their educational content. In adding education content selection and delivery are key factors. Robo-advising also should focus on the demography of users and target who to better serve to and attract from this base. Expanding crypto trading should also be seamless with the app.

Robinhood's point of differentiation and sustanble competitive advantage lies in its mobile app. Number of reviwers consistantly rank their app as superior product compared to others. The trick is how to improve with out ceding ground on such a stellr platform.
