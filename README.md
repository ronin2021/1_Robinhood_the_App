# Robinhood and the Attempt to Democratize of the Finance

## Overview and Origin

Robinhood is a reasonably new Fintech company which was incorporated April, 2013. Stanford graduates Vladimir Tenev and Baiju Bhatt founded the company in Menlo Park, California. While working/building high frequency trading platforms in New York city they noted that typical trading platforms incur fraction of dollar, on the order of few pennies, while charging customers $5 to $10 per trade. Further, it was (and still is to certain extent) required that the individual investor sustain a minimum dollar value in their account, which typically varies between $500 to $5000, depending on the broker. Tanev and Bhatt wanted to remove this barrier and encourage anyone who has some money that they could invest to participate in buying equity, not just the reasonably wealthy. 

Robinhood has manged to attract substantial cash inflows via close, successive funding rounds which attest to the robustness of their product, messaging and marketing in convincing sophisticated tech Venture Capital (VC) firms in the Silicon Valley. In its onset funding started with a Seed round (2013) at $3mil from a collection of boutique VC firms (led by Andreessen Horowitz et. al.,), followed by a Series A round at $13mil (2014) led by Index Ventures. This was followed by a Series B round at $50mil (2015) led by Index Ventures, then a Series B round (2017) at $110mil at Valuation of $1.3bil (then becoming a bonafide Unicorn) again led by Index Ventures. 

More recently, from May of 2018 to August of 2020, successive Series D, D-2, E, E-1, F, F, G-1 funding rounds attrated a cumulative capital of $1.5bil, capping off with Series G-2 in Covid hit September of 2020 of $460mil at a valuation of $11.7bil lead by Sequoia Capital.

Robinhood is still privately held and likely to remain so in near future. The recent abundance of SPACs and having convinced VC firms with deep pockets will likely guarentee a ready supply of growth capital with the control so desired by the founders as opposed to an IPO.   

## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?
Since trading stocks via then-existing brokerages can be expensive and requires some reasonable capital to park in their brokerage this removes a certain demography of users from participating in the capital markets.  This is a considerable pain point and disenfranchises a large group of people from participating on equity markets.     

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?



What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)
